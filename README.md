# Credit Default Risk Prediction

This project uses a logistic regression model to predict the probability of loan default based on customer characteristics such as age, income, loan amount, and credit score. It analyzes risk factors and provides classification results to support credit decision-making.

## Key Features
- Simulated credit risk dataset with demographic and financial variables
- Logistic regression model for binary classification (default vs no default)
- Evaluation using classification report and confusion matrix visualization
- Probability predictions for customer default risk

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Example Outputs
- Classification report (precision, recall, F1-score)
- Confusion matrix heatmap
- Example predicted probabilities for customer default

## Notes
- Dataset is synthetic for educational purposes.
